# Movie-review-sentiment-analyzer-app

In today's world, while going with the ratings of the movie, we often tend to forget to go through the reviews and judge the sentiment of the audience , because who will go through big reviews!

But as human we prefer is? A verbal review of the movie or the series from a very known person of ours who have seen it.

So here's why comes, my Movik_app, inspite of just going by public ratings , it also goes by public sentiments in the written reviews using Natural language processing.

So once, a movie/series name is provided by the user to my app. My app gives the public ratings and predicts the public sentiment by juding the written reviews.

# And here' s Movik_App stands out in the crowd.
